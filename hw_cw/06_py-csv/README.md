File I/O --> We read in the CSV file using a basic Python module with the same name (csv). From this module we imported the DictReader class into our program
which allowed us to quickly convert the file's raw data into something usable. We then shifted the data line by line from the DictReader object into a standard Python dictionary.

Dictionary --> The dictionary allowed us to easily store and access two-column, unordered data (an essential part of the exercise). We set up the dictionary by assigning key-value pairs as follows (example_dict["example key"] = value), and accessing them by key (example_dict["key"]), and using the .items() function in the dictionary class, converting into an iterable.

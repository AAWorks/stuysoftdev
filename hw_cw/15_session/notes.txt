K15 -- Sessions Greetings
2021-10-14

10/18 --> Currently figuring out sessions and buttons in flask.

Ultimately biggest hurdle to jump was on how to use session, as we spent a lot of time
attempting to figure out the source of the error we were receiving. Turns out our code 
was in fact correct, but was missing the secret key used to encode data. Once this was
figured out by conversing with other devs, the rest came together swiftly and neatly.
